### About this project

This repository contains an epidemic simulation based on MATSim, provided by the [Transport Systems Planning and Transport Telematics group](https://www.vsp.tu-berlin.de) of [Technische Universit√§t Berlin](http://www.tu-berlin.de).

### How to use Episim

In order perform an epidemic simulation you first need an MATSim events file.
To get started you can also use a provided event file from the [OpenBerlin Scenario](https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/matsim/scenarios/countries/de/berlin/berlin-v5.4-1pct-schools/output-berlin-v5.4-1pct-schools/berlin-v5.4-1pct-schools.output_events_for_episim.xml.gz).

It is best to run the scenarios with your IDE from the `org.matsim.episim.run` package.
Please edit `RunEpisim.class` and change it according to your configuration.

You can also build the jar file, which will run the scenario with a default configuration:

    mvn package

And run it with:

    java -jar matsim-episim-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    

### Generating mobility traces events file

If you have a MATSim scenario you can also create your own event file to be used for an epidemic simulation.
All that is needed is the population and the event file of one iteration.

Run `DownSampleScenario` to extract the necessary information: 

    DownSampleScenario 0.1 --population <Path to plans.xml> --events <Path to events.xml>

This example will write a 10% sample into `output` that can be used in the subsequent steps.
